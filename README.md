# Shortest Path Visualiser

An interactive, web-based tool for visualizing classic shortest path algorithms on real-world road networks. Powered by live data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and built with Vanilla JavaScript and Leaflet.js.

---

## Core Features

* **Live OSM Data Integration**: Dynamically fetches and renders road networks (highways) for any location worldwide using the Overpass API.
* **On-the-Fly Graph Generation**: Instantly converts raw geographic data from OSM into a functional graph structure (nodes and adjacency lists) ready for pathfinding.
* **Multiple Algorithm Support**:
    * **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: The classic, guaranteeing the shortest path on networks with non-negative edge weights.
    * **A\* Search**: A powerful heuristic-based algorithm that intelligently finds the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's in most real-world scenarios.
    * **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Capable of handling negative edge weights, included for academic and demonstration purposes.
* **Intuitive Map Interface**: Simply click on the map to define your **start** and **end** points. The application automatically snaps to the nearest valid road intersection.
* **Zero-Dependency Codebase**: The entire application is contained within a single HTML file. No build tools, no frameworks, no complex setup—just open `index.html` and go. It's incredibly easy to read, modify, and extend.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    First, get the code by cloning the repository. You can **[click here to visit the repository page](https://github.com/sbmec04-lab/Shortest_Path_finder)** or run the following command in your terminal:
    
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sbmec04-lab/Shortest_Path_finder.git](https://github.com/sbmec04-lab/Shortest_Path_finder.git)
    cd shortest_path
    ```

2.  **Open in Browser**

    Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

3.  **Find a Path**
    * Pan and zoom to your desired area.
    * Click **"Load graph around map center"** to fetch the local road data.
    * Set your **Start** and **End** points with two clicks on the map.
    * Choose an algorithm from the dropdown and click **"Find Path"**.
    * The optimal route will be drawn on the map, with distance and time metrics displayed in the log.

## Implementation Details

* **Graph Model**: The road network is modeled as a graph where nodes are OSM IDs with associated coordinates. The graph is stored in an adjacency list for efficient traversal.
* **Edge Weights**: Edge weights represent real-world distances (in meters) between two nodes, calculated precisely using the **Haversine formula**.
* **Priority Queue**: A custom-built **MinHeap** data structure is used to ensure efficient implementation of Dijkstra’s and A* algorithms.
* **Data Sourcing**: The **Overpass API** is queried to retrieve all `highway` elements within the current map's bounding box.
* **UI & Rendering**: The entire user interface and map rendering are handled with lightweight **HTML, CSS, and Leaflet.js**.

## Algorithms Explained

* **Dijkstra**: A foundational algorithm that explores nodes in order of increasing distance from the source. It is guaranteed to find the absolute shortest path.
* **A***: An optimized version of Dijkstra that uses a heuristic (Euclidean distance to the target) to guide its search, significantly reducing computation time by exploring in the right direction.
* **Bellman-Ford**: A more robust algorithm that can handle graphs with negative edge weights, though it is slower ($O(VE)$) than the alternatives.
